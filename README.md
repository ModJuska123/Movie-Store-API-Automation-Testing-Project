1. Install Newman globally:

    
    npm install -g newman
    

2. Run the Postman collection with Newman:

    
    newman run postman/collection.json -e postman/environment.json
    

## GitHub Workflow

This project uses GitHub Actions for CI/CD. The workflow is defined in `.github/workflows/node.js.yml`. Hereâ€™s a brief overview:

- **Node.js CI**: This workflow runs on push and pull request events to the `main` branch.
- It installs dependencies, runs tests, and lints the code.
