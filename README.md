## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version X.X.X or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) (Node Package Manager)
- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) (for API testing)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
Navigate to the project directory:

sh
Copy code
cd your-repo-name
Install the dependencies:

sh
Copy code
npm install
Running the Application
To start the application, run:

sh
Copy code
npm start
The application should now be running at http://localhost:3000.

Using Postman
Open Postman and import the provided collection:

The Postman collection file is located at postman/collection.json.
Click on "Import" in Postman, select the file, and import it.
Set up your environment:

The environment file is located at postman/environment.json.
Click on "Import" in the Environments tab and select the file.
Use the imported collection to test the API endpoints.

Automated Testing with Newman
Newman allows you to run Postman collections from the command line. Follow these steps to run automated tests:

Install Newman globally:

sh
Copy code
npm install -g newman
Run the Postman collection with Newman:

sh
Copy code
newman run postman/collection.json -e postman/environment.json
GitHub Workflow
This project uses GitHub Actions for CI/CD. The workflow is defined in .github/workflows/node.js.yml. Here’s a brief overview:

Node.js CI: This workflow runs on push and pull request events to the main branch.
It installs dependencies, runs tests, and lints the code.
Example of the GitHub Actions workflow file:

yaml
Copy code
name: Node.js CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [14.x, 16.x]

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}
      uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      with:
        node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
    - run: npm install
    - run: npm test
    - run: npm run lint
Contributing
We welcome contributions! Please follow these steps to contribute:

Fork the repository.
Create a new branch (git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name).
Make your changes.
Commit your changes (git commit -m 'Add some feature').
